Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on becoming a Cloud engineer!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AWS and Game Development for future indie solo projects
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with a real world road map to land an entry level Cloud Engineer job.......(if those still even exist...lol)
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about authentic Mexican cuisine!
